## Latest Updates

My latest release for Octal, which only contains bug fixes, is being rejected by Apple's App Store Review team. They are asking me to do things that I definitely should not have to do as a Hacker News client app. I am currently going through a very slow and frustrating appeal process and don't have any ETA.

Their reasons for rejecting are:

> **Guideline 4.2.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality**

> We continue to find that your app includes content aggregated from the internet, but does not allow users to view the full articles within the app.

> To resolve this issue, please revise your app to include full articles, instead of taking the user to Safari.

> **Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated Content**

> Your app enables the display of user-generated content but does not have the proper precautions in place.

> To resolve this issue, please revise your app to implement all of the following precautions:

> - Require that users agree to terms (EULA) and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users
> - A method for filtering objectionable content
> - A mechanism for users to flag objectionable content
> - A mechanism for users to block abusive users
> - The developer must act on objectionable content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content

> **Guideline 4.0 - Design**

> We noticed that not all users are able to access the full functionality of the app after purchasing Octal Premium, as they are required to log in, but the app > does not include account creation.

> It would be appropriate to revise your app to provide a mechanism that allows any user to immediately access the purchased functionalities.

> ~~**Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage**~~ (resolved after initial appeal)

> We found in our review that your app provides services or requires sensitive user information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, services and information related to it are considered to be part of the healthcare industry. In addition, the seller and company names associated with your app are not from a recognized institution, such as a governmental entity, hospital, insurance company, non-governmental organization, or university.

> Per section 5.1.1 (ix) of the App Store Review Guidelines, apps that provide services or collect sensitive user information in highly-regulated fields, such as healthcare, should be submitted by a legal entity that provides these services, and not by an individual developer.
